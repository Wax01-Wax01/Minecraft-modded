# The Hardest Items To Obtain [TOP *🔟*] (According to Wax01-Wax01)

## TOP 🥇: Explosive Pickaxe (Fortune I)
### This item requires an explosive pickaxe, and 3 lotteries. 3 lotteries is no joke as of now!
## TOP 🥈: Block Break (Fortune I)
### 2 lotteries. 2 lotteries is no joke as of now!
## TOP 🥉: Lottery (>= 2)
### Lotteries aren't very easy to get. No wonder how the top 2 need lotteries to make!
## TOP 4️⃣: Diamond
### Going Mining! Well maybe you should loot villages instead...
## TOP 5️⃣: Gold
### Why do you want this anyway?
## TOP 6️⃣: Flint and Steel:
### Actually kinda useful! Explodes TNT.
## TOP 7️⃣: Lucky Block
### Sure. It usually takes a good while to get a good amount of stone.
## TOP 8️⃣: Magma
### Coal, and stone. Nice.
## TOP 9️⃣: Flint
### 2 less stone than #8! No wonder why it's #9! (And don't say it's #40320 and #362880. It's not factorial.)
## TOP 🔟: Sapling
### Who grinds for this? It's a 1 in 6 drop. Not very easy if you're normally unlucky and impatient.
